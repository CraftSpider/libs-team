# Lock Poisoning Survey

Raw results from the [Lock Poisoning Survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/11/lock-poisoning-survey.html) in CSV format. This directory also includes a quick tool to reprocess the raw results into a JSON array for analysis.

All you need is to:

```
cargo run --release
```

from this directory and a JSON array will be emitted to `stdout`.

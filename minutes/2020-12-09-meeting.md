## Triage

### Nominated

(Should be discussed in a meeting.)

- [2 `rust-lang/rfcs` items](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AT-libs+label%3AI-nominated)
  - [[2477](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2477)] *RFC: Add the \`group\_by\` and \`group\_by\_mut\` methods to slice*
    Discussed in the 2020-11-18 meeting, but still requires a response. (And an apology for letting it wait two years? ^^')
    - Responded!
  - [[2979](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2979)] *\[RFC\]: Libs Team Governance*
- [4 `rust-lang/rust` items](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AT-libs+label%3AI-nominated)
  - [[63291](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63291)] *Tracking issue for uninitialized constructors for Box, Rc, Arc*
      - Arc/Rc APIs seem a bit awkward to work with, but Box impls seem reasonable.
      - Probably move Box constructors to `Box<MaybeUninit<T>>` rather than `Box<T>`.
      - Some kind of builder API might be better for Arc/Rc.
  - [[66481](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66481)] *Context and Waker might be accidentally \`Sync\`*
      - Punt until Boats is back.
  - [[68490](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68490)] *Tracking issue for RFC 2700: numeric constants as associated consts*
      - Deprecate the "soft-deprecated" method variants
      - Leave the consts modules as-is
  - [[77801](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77801)] *Enforce no\-move rule of ReentrantMutex using Pin and fix UB in stdio*
    Backported to two betas, but still needs to be reviewed for nightly.
    - `DerefPin`!
    - Some method resolution / `Deref` coersion for `Pin<Box<T>>`? Makes `Pin` too special?
        - `mypin.method()` where mypin is `Pin<Box<T>>` and method takes `self: Pin<&mut T>`

# Libs Meeting 2021-02-17/18

###### tags: `Libs Meetings` `Minutes`

**Attendees**: sfackler, dtolnay, joshtriplett, scottmcm, amanieu, yaahc, bstrie, KodrAus, Mara

## Agenda

- [Open action items](https://hackmd.io/ovrbJj6CRduRgSA0Wzg2zg)
- [Try trait v2](https://github.com/scottmcm/rfcs/blob/do-or-do-not/text/0000-try-trait-v2.md#summary)
- ~~Edition range changes~~
- ~~Triage~~
- ~~Anything else?~~

## Try trait

- Consider a `FromTryOutput` trait for types you can inspect and break on, but can't construct (such as errors from FFI). That would split `from_output` off of `Try`.
    - Path forward: follow exactly what the RFC follows and see whether people run into `from_output`.
- On naming: is it possible to reduce the number of distinct nouns we introduce? Do _Continue_ and _Break_ work?
    - Path forward: follow the _Residual_ naming and see if better names come forward in the meantime.

- Look at crater breakage from `Option` to `Result` breakage.

Two crater runs:

- One with the RFC as-written including the workaround for `Option` to `Result`.
- One without the workaround for `Option` to `Result`.

## Triage

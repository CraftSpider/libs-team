### Nominated

- [1 `rust-lang/rfcs` items](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AT-libs+label%3AI-nominated)
  - [[2979](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2979)] *\[RFC\]: Libs Team Governance*
- [7 `rust-lang/rust` items](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AT-libs+label%3AI-nominated)
  - [[66481](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66481)] *Context and Waker might be accidentally \`Sync\`*
    - Moved to wg-async-foundations last meeting.
  - [[72981](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72981)] *Stabilize the backtrace feature.*
    FCP finished. Should be merged?
    - Type in core, all methods as an extension trait in std, imported `as _` into prelude
    - Alternatively: wait on std+core unification?
    - Check if we can add `impl Type` to std for types of core. This might be okay for non-trait stuff.
  - [[74304](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74304)] *Stabilize the Wake trait*
    FCP finished. Should be merged?
    - Looks ready to be merged. Fine without the blanket impl.
  - [[79245](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79245)] *BTreeMap: remove Ord bound where it will never be needed*
    FCP finished. Should be merged?
    - Still moving.
  - usize::BITS causing breakage - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76904
    - Investigate: Stabilize for a future release? Warnings/errors about those should not be supressed by cap-lints.
    - Revert for now
    - lexical-core looks unmaintained. owner inactive on github, last commit long ago.
    - Maybe it can be fixed in `nom`, as the biggest consumer of this crate?
  - [[80962](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80962)] *Stabilize remaining integer methods as \`const fn\`*
    - FCP already started. nothing to discuss.
  - [[81382](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81382)] *Make \`is\_sorted\[\_by\_key\]\` require \`Ord\` instead of \`PartialOrd\` and remove \`Iterator::is\_sorted\_by\_key\`*
    - PartialOrd is fine, as that matches `<=`.
  - [[81460](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81460)] *regression 1.51: lifetime may not live long enough with \`&impl Error\`*
    - This was expected. Wontfix.
